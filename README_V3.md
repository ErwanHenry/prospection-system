## 🏗️ System Overview (TL;DR)

### The 4-Agent Architecture

```
1. ProspectQualifierAgent (The Filter)
   → Scores prospects 0-100
   → Rejects 70% BEFORE outreach
   → Enriches qualified prospects

2. MessageGeneratorAgent (The Creative)
   → Generates "insolite" (surprising) messages
   → 3 variants per touch (A/B/C testing)
   → AI-powered personalization

3. WorkflowOrchestratorAgent (The Conductor)
   → Multi-touch sequences (5 touches, 18 days)
   → Anti-ban logic (human-like, rate limits)
   → LinkedIn + Email coordination

4. EngagementTrackerAgent (The Monitor)
   → Real-time signal tracking
   → Temperature scoring (hot/warm/cold)
   → Auto-adjust workflows
```

### The Funnel (30-Day Forecast)

```
200 prospects imported
    ↓ (70% filter)
60 qualified (30%)
    ↓ (5 touches each)
300 touches sent
    ↓ (8% reply rate)
15 hot leads
    ↓ (66% demo conversion)
10 demos booked ✅
```

### The "Insolite" Strategy

**5 Templates That Get Replies**:

1. **Data Surprise**: "5 SDRs × 45K€ = 225K€/an. 1 IA = 24K€. Je vous montre ?"
2. **Meta Confession**: "Mon IA a scanné 2,847 profils pour vous trouver. Score: 91%."
3. **Reverse Pitch**: "Je ne veux PAS vous vendre. 5 min pour comprendre ?"
4. **Proof Point**: "89% de précision. Vous êtes dans les 11% ?"
5. **Industry Insight**: "Les meilleurs leaders n'utilisent plus d'humains pour qualifier."
