2. In the left sidebar, expand **Cookies**
3. Click on `https://www.linkedin.com`

### 4. Find the `li_at` Cookie

1. In the cookies list, look for a cookie named **`li_at`**
2. Click on it to see its details
3. Copy the **Value** field (it's a long string of characters)

### 5. Add to the System

#### Option A: Via Web Interface
